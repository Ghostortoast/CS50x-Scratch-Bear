# CS50x-Scratch-Bear
# Ghostortoast 

# This program was created for CS50x by Harvard and edX. It uses Scratch, an interactive, easy to use coding platform for beginners. 
# Scratch was designed and used by MIT. It can be accessed by visiting https://scratch.mit.edu/ 
# 
# This short game I have made was inspired by The World's Hardest Game, published by Flash Game Studio, and Ivy's Hardest Game, made by Harvard. 
# In this game, the user controls a Bear. The Bear must find food before hibernating for the winter, to avoid starvation. 
# If the player collects an apple, the Hunger meter gets reset back to 100.
# Be careful and avoid bumping against the walls, this will send the player back to the start of the level. 
# If the player fails to find the food in time, the Bear will starve, requiring the player to try again. 
# 
# Standard WASD controls apply. Hit Spacebar after the introduction dialogue has completed to begin playing the game. 
# There is a 100 second timer, represented by Hunger. This timer shows the player roughly how much time they have left before the bear begins to starve. 
# Once the Hunger meter reaches zero, the bear will starve, and the player will have to try again from level 1. 
#  
# All levels have been play tested by different players before publishing, each level is passible. The levels will get progressively difficult as the player progresses through the game. 
# The goal of the game is to teach players to make careful decisions and to slow down and take a more thought-out approach to the Bear's movement, traversing through the levels.
# The player has to reach level 5 before completing the game and winning.
#
# Thank you for trying my game out, I hope it was enjoyable and fun, as simple as it is.
